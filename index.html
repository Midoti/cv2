        <h3>Rocket League</h3>
        <p>I started playing Rocket League when it was released in 2015 and i got hooked and played it until now. Season 3 is the first season, that I hit Grand Champion. Even though some would consider it as easy am I still happy about that
          achievement. Nowadays I'm playing on a 1800 level. 1820 is my peak. Currently I'm playing for the Rocket League Team Over The Wings. It consists of Nightshaver, Zym, and me.</p>

        <h3>Hot Chillies</h3>
        <p class="boy">Hot chillies are very cool so look out for them. If you buy these super hot ones just to make yourself cry. Be sure not wipe your eyes. The coolest and hottest chilli is the Carolina Reaper pepper with an average of 1.569.300
          Scoville Heat Units.</p>
